My work from first Assignment of Software Workshop 1 in my Year in Computer Science.
I got 100% on this assignment! :)

It's worth noting that we were limited to a very small set of built-in functions for this assignment - they were trying to encourage us to figure out how to solve the problems and think "outside the box". It was also completed under timed conditions.
